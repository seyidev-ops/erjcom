   FIND YOUR LEAK · four-point diagnostic  (dx.ts)
   Compile: tsc diagnose/dx.ts --target es2017 --strict --lib es2017,dom

   Four questions, weighted. Each answer adds to one or two joints;
   the highest total wins, with an explicit tie-break that prefers
   the EARLIEST joint in the pipe — because a leak upstream makes
   every downstream reading unreliable. Someone who cannot find
   real roles has no meaningful conversion data yet.

   Nothing is stored. No email field, no analytics, no cookies.
   The only exit is a WhatsApp message the person chooses to send.
